## 1. Short Description

Task List is a simple task list application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks to a list, remove tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

## 3. Technologies Used

The application was built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- React JavaScript
- Babel
- webpack

The HTML structure consists of a form for adding new tasks, a tasks list container for displaying tasks, and a heading for the list of tasks. The form has an input field for typing task content and a "Dodaj zadanie" (Add Task) button for submitting the form.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the to-do list. It includes functions for adding new tasks, removing tasks, and toggling the "done" status of tasks. Event listeners are used to capture user actions, such as form submission, button clicks, and task removal.

The CSS code is used for styling the web application. It includes styles for the form, tasks list, buttons, and other elements. The CSS uses the Montserrat font from Google Fonts and the Normalize CSS library for cross-browser consistency.

## How to Ggt started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
